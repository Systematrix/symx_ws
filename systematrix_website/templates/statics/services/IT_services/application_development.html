                  <ul>
                    <li> The software is in complete harmony with the operating  system. </li>
                    <li> The software does not hinder the legitimate demands of other  software on the resources of the host system. </li>
                    <li> The user is able to derive optimum benefits available from  the usage of the software and other relevant computing resources. </li>
                    <li> The user fully understands the usage and thereby resulting  consequences of the various features in the system. </li>
                    <li> If the software has to perform tasks for various networked  or discrete users, the hierarchy of controls has been completely defined,  documented and implemented </li>
                    <li> It has been exhaustively verified that all the features and  options available on the software are completely usable within pre-set  parameters. </li>
                    <li> Back-ups of data created by the usage of the software can be  smoothly managed with the current levels of automation. </li>
                    <li> Updates to the software are easily and naturally possible  using the currently available resources.</li>
                    <li>Re-development of the  software if required at a future point in time can be accomplished, using the  installation report created. </li>
                    <li> A proper documentation of all the additional third-party  inputs, operating system parameters has been made.                  </li>
